# DrumkitOnline

A challange from my Udemy course - The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu. The drumkit allows users to play directly on
the browswer by keyboards or mouse control. 

The challenge's purpose is to practice using Javascrip's DOM manipulation, event listener, if else/switch statement, and callback functions.
